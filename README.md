# _Ruffle_ Demo (Standalone Version)

This is the code you need to play your _Flash_ animations using _Ruffle_ (instead of the player from _Adobe_).

_Ruffle_ is work in progress. If you have an issue, please [report it](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/issues/new).

The main advantage of _Ruffle_ standalone is that it brings _Flash_ to the web, so any modern browser may play it.

Contents are:

1. `006699.swf`: sample animation.

1. `index.md`: HTML source, which contains the animation.

1. All other files are from _Ruffle_ standalone (`ruffle_nightly_2020_11_28_selfhosted.zip`, but you should choose [the latest release](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/releases/latest)).

Result is served at https://ousia.github.com/ruffle-demo/.
